# LinearProgramming
Examples of practice exercise of optimization problems

This repository was created to host linear programming (AKA Optimization) problems.
It has many programming examples from visualizing the feasibility region of a problem,
single optimal outputs, to a vector of optimal solutions when more than one solution
is optimal.
